# Road Map for naparistreamdeck

The interface will rely on toggling between layers using the touch screen. The type of layer currently selected will determine which dials and buttons are available. The user will be able to toggle the view on the touch screen to enable the user to switch through different options for the dials (dial view) or see and switch between layers (layer view). When in layer view, the first two dials will operate the axis sliders.
